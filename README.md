# Semi-Supervised-Learning-for-Text-Classification
<li>Machine Learning Project used to classify the text using Multinomial Naive Bayes and Expectation Maximization Algorithm. 
<li>Small amount of labelled data was given as input and trained the model using Supervised Learning(Multinomial Naive Bayes). 
<li>Large number of unlabelled data was used for prediction. 
<li>Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, etc,. were plotted for easy visualization
